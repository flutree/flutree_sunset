        <h1>Flutree has been sunsetted ðŸ˜¢</h1>
        <p>
            Flutree has reached 50,000 installs, yet close to celebrating the anniversary date, but the time has come to
            finally say goodbye.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a difficult decision to make. Tonight, Flutree's mobile and web will no longer be available for
            download in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iqmal.linktreeflutter"
                target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google Play Store</a> or accessible on the <a
                href="https://flutree.studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">flutree.studio</a> site. That means users
            no longer can create a new profile or update the existing one.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, <a href="https://flutree.web.app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">flutree.web.app</a> will
            continue serving visitors until <b>31 August 2021</b>. Please migrate to another service to avoid any
            inconvenience.
        </p>
        <h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
        <p>
        <p>Flutree is no longer generating enough revenue to support the costs of maintaining it.</p>
        <p>
            We received a tremendous number of visitors that makes the hosting costs went beyond the roof. On the other
            hand, we didn't gain enough ads impressions from the app.
        </p>
        </p>
        <h3>So, what's next?</h3>
        <p>Move on and (perhaps) reconstruct a better business model.</p>
